# === Universal Code Security Analysis: AI-Driven Comprehensive Security Assessment Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**
1. **READ AND INDEX**: Complete ai-agent-compliance.md protocol requirements
2. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**
- Making large, non-atomic changes
- Skipping tests or validation
- Ignoring build/deploy errors
- Proceeding without understanding
- Creating duplicate functionality
- Using outdated patterns

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **NO MOCKING** of data or services in production code
- **NO TODOs** - complete ALL work immediately
- **NO SHORTCUTS** - implement properly ALWAYS
- **NO STUBS** - write complete implementations
- **NO FIXED DATA** - use real, dynamic data
- **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - use configuration
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - fix root causes
- **NO FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - real code only
- **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - production-ready only
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS** - permanent fixes only

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS:**
   - Search for .ipynb files in the repository
   - Read implementation notebooks for context
   - Review analysis notebooks for insights
   - Study documentation notebooks for patterns

2. **READ PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:**
   - Check `./docs` directory thoroughly
   - Check `./project/docs` if it exists
   - Read ALL README files
   - Review architecture documentation
   - Study API documentation

3. **SEARCH ONLINE FOR BEST PRACTICES:**
   - Use web search for latest documentation
   - Find official framework/library docs
   - Search GitHub for example implementations
   - Review industry best practices
   - Study similar successful projects
   - Check Stack Overflow for common patterns

**SEARCH PRIORITIES:**
- Official documentation (latest version)

# Security Remediation Priority
remediation_matrix:
  immediate: # < 24 hours
    - Remote code execution
    - Authentication bypass
    - Data breach potential
    - Active exploitation
  
  urgent: # < 1 week
    - SQL injection
    - Privilege escalation
    - Cryptographic failures
    - Critical misconfigurations
  
  high: # < 1 month
    - XSS vulnerabilities
    - Insecure communications
    - Weak authentication
    - Missing encryption
  
  medium: # < 3 months
    - Information disclosure
    - Missing security headers
    - Outdated components
    - Logging deficiencies

# Execution Workflow
execution_steps: |
  1. MANDATORY: Load context from neo4j-memory and memory before starting
  2. MANDATORY: Research using context7 and grep for latest security analysis patterns
  3. Inventory all system components and attack surface
  4. Perform static security analysis (SAST)
  5. Scan for known vulnerabilities (SCA)
  6. Analyze security configurations
  7. Detect secrets and credentials
  8. Assess cryptographic implementations
  9. Model threats and attack scenarios
  10. Calculate risk scores and impact
  11. Generate compliance matrices
  12. Create prioritized remediation plan
  13. MANDATORY: Save all findings and decisions to neo4j-memory and memory
  14. MANDATORY: Use reverse date stamps for all output files

## MCP PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SECURITY ANALYSIS OPERATIONS:**

1. **🔴 ALWAYS use context7 BEFORE analyzing security** - Get current, accurate security documentation
2. **🔴 ALWAYS use grep to search GitHub** - Find real production examples of security patterns
3. **🔴 ALWAYS record actions in neo4j-memory and memory AS YOU WORK** - Document everything
4. **🔴 ALWAYS save to neo4j-memory and memory** - Preserve for future sessions
5. **NEVER skip the Context Load phase** - Always start by loading relevant context
6. **NEVER analyze without Research phase** - context7 + grep are MANDATORY
7. **NEVER complete without Context Save** - Always persist learnings and decisions

**THE GOLDEN RULE: context7 (docs) → grep (examples) → memory (record) → analysis → memory (persist)**

## MANDATORY REVERSE DATE STAMP REQUIREMENTS

**ALL OUTPUT FILES AND DOCUMENTATION MUST USE REVERSE DATE STAMP FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS**

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- "MANDATORY: Use reverse date stamp format YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS for ALL output files"
- "MANDATORY: Include UTC timestamps in all documentation and deliverables"
- "MANDATORY: Apply consistent date stamp format across all session outputs"
- "MANDATORY: Use time MCP tool to generate proper timestamps"
- "MANDATORY: Include date stamps in all memory operations and file creation"

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "FORBIDDEN: Creating any output files without proper reverse date stamps"
- "FORBIDDEN: Using inconsistent date formats within same session"
- "FORBIDDEN: Missing timestamps in any documentation or deliverables"
