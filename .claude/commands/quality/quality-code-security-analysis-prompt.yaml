# Security Analysis Execution Workflow with Mandatory Date Stamp Tracking
execution_steps:
  - "1. INVENTORY system components and map attack surface comprehensively"
  - "2. PERFORM static application security testing (SAST) with vulnerability detection"
  - "3. ANALYZE security configurations and infrastructure protection"
  - "4. ASSESS cryptography implementation and secrets management"
  - "5. EVALUATE dependency security and supply chain risks"
  - "6. CONDUCT threat modeling with STRIDE methodology"
  - "7. CALCULATE risk scores using CVSS and business impact analysis"
  - "8. VALIDATE compliance against security frameworks and standards"
  - "9. PREPARE penetration testing targets and attack scenarios"
  - "10. COMPILE comprehensive security report and remediation plan"
  - "11. VALIDATE findings accuracy and evidence reproducibility"
  - "12. DELIVER structured outputs with timestamp documentation"

date_stamp_execution_requirements:
