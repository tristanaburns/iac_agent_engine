# === Universal Code Validation: AI-Driven Implementation Verification Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**
1. **READ AND INDEX**: Complete ai-agent-compliance.md protocol requirements
2. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**
- Making large, non-atomic changes

# Execution Workflow
execution_steps: |
  1. MANDATORY: Load context from neo4j-memory and memory before starting
  2. MANDATORY: Research using context7 and grep for latest validation patterns
  3. Load planning and implementation artifacts
  4. Extract validation criteria and targets
  5. Execute automated validation checks
  6. Perform manual inspections
  7. Compare expected vs. actual results
  8. Identify gaps and deviations
  9. Assess impact and risks
  10. Generate compliance matrices
  11. Make certification decision
  12. Produce validation report and recommendations
  13. MANDATORY: Save all findings and decisions to neo4j-memory and memory
  14. MANDATORY: Use reverse date stamps for all output files

## MCP PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL VALIDATION OPERATIONS:**

1. **🔴 ALWAYS use context7 BEFORE validation** - Get current, accurate validation documentation
2. **🔴 ALWAYS use grep to search GitHub** - Find real production examples of validation patterns
3. **🔴 ALWAYS record actions in neo4j-memory and memory AS YOU WORK** - Document everything
4. **🔴 ALWAYS save to neo4j-memory and memory** - Preserve for future sessions
5. **NEVER skip the Context Load phase** - Always start by loading relevant context
6. **NEVER validate without Research phase** - context7 + grep are MANDATORY
7. **NEVER complete without Context Save** - Always persist learnings and decisions

**THE GOLDEN RULE: context7 (docs) → grep (examples) → memory (record) → validation → memory (persist)**

## MANDATORY REVERSE DATE STAMP REQUIREMENTS

**ALL OUTPUT FILES AND DOCUMENTATION MUST USE REVERSE DATE STAMP FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS**

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- "MANDATORY: Use reverse date stamp format YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS for ALL output files"
- "MANDATORY: Include UTC timestamps in all documentation and deliverables"
- "MANDATORY: Apply consistent date stamp format across all session outputs"
- "MANDATORY: Use time MCP tool to generate proper timestamps"
- "MANDATORY: Include date stamps in all memory operations and file creation"

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "FORBIDDEN: Creating any output files without proper reverse date stamps"
- "FORBIDDEN: Using inconsistent date formats within same session"
- "FORBIDDEN: Missing timestamps in any documentation or deliverables"
