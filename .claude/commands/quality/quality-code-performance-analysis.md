### **MCP Extended-Memory**
**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
- Save ALL context, outcomes, knowledge and decisions to MCP extended-memory
- Update MCP extended-memory when missing or incomplete content exists
- Use MCP extended-memory to understand previous session context before starting
- Search with date props and pagination for past 4-48 hours of entries

### **MCP Memory**
**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
- Use MCP memory to get current progress, actions and context before proceeding
- Add or update MCP memory entries when content is missing or incomplete

### **MCP Memory Tracking**
**AT END OF EACH TASK/ACTION/STEP:**
- Use MCP memory to track progress and execution
**AT END OF SESSION:**
- Use MCP extended-memory to persist outcomes, knowledge and decisions
