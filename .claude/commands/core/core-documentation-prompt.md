# Documentation Protocol - Mandatory Protocol Instructions

### PROTOCOL HIERARCHY
This protocol must be read and applied AFTER:
1. `code-protocol-compliance-prompt.md` - Base compliance requirements and requirements language
2. `code-protocol-single-branch-strategy.md` - Git workflow requirements

### MANDATORY READING REQUIREMENT
**BEFORE ANY DOCUMENTATION CREATION, YOU MUST:**
- **MUST READ AND INDEX:** `documentation-protocol-strategy.md` - Documentation philosophy, methods, and procedures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CANONICAL DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL - ABSOLUTE ENFORCEMENT

### PRODUCTION CODE DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED INSTRUCTION

**THIS IS A PRODUCTION CODE DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED INSTRUCTION AND YOU ARE NOT TO CREATE DOCUMENTATION UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO.**

**CANONICAL MANDATORY PROTOCOL DIRECTIVE:**

- **MUST NOT** create documentation proactively or by assumption
- **MUST ONLY** create documentation when explicitly instructed by user
- **MUST** comply with enduring documentation directive at all times
- **SHALL** destroy any documentation that does not comply with this directive
- **FORBIDDEN:** Any temporal or action-based documentation creation

### RFC 2119 COMPLIANCE - DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

**ENDURING DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES:**

- **MUST** create enduring documentation that explains HOW TO USE the system
- **MUST NOT** create temporal documents on what actions were performed
- **MUST** include date-stamped and version-controlled filenames
- **SHALL** use clear filenames identifying date, version, focus, feature, and content
- **MUST** comply with mandatory protocol at all times
- **SHALL** ensure all documentation is production-focused and enduring

**PROJECT DIRECTORY PROTOCOL:**

- **MUST** recognize `./project/` directory as primary source for project development information
- **SHALL** use `./project/` directory content as authoritative source for project context
- **MUST** preserve all informational content found in `./project/` directory structure
- **FORBIDDEN** destroying or harming any content that appears to be informational or external documentation

**EXTERNAL CONTENT PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**

## COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT

### CANONICAL DIRECTIVE ENFORCEMENT

**DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL:**

Any documentation that does not comply with this directive **WILL BE DESTROYED** according to the canonical mandate:

- **Non-compliant filenames** - Destroyed and recreated with proper naming
- **Temporal content** - Destroyed and replaced with enduring content
- **Proactive documentation** - Destroyed as it violates production-focused directive
- **Action-based documentation** - Destroyed and replaced with usage-focused content

**COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:**

Before any documentation creation, verify:
1. ‚úÖ Explicitly instructed to create documentation
2. ‚úÖ Production code deployment focused
3. ‚úÖ Enduring HOW-TO-USE content
4. ‚úÖ Date-stamped, version-controlled filename
5. ‚úÖ Clear identification of date, version, focus, feature, content

---

## CANONICAL DIRECTIVES SUMMARY

1. **PRODUCTION CODE DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED** - Only create when explicitly instructed
2. **ENDURING DOCUMENTATION ONLY** - HOW TO USE, not what was done
3. **MANDATORY FILENAME CONVENTION** - Date-stamped, version-controlled, clear identification
4. **DESTRUCTION OF NON-COMPLIANCE** - Any non-compliant documentation will be destroyed
5. **VERSION CONTROL REQUIRED** - All documentation must be version controlled
6. **EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION ONLY** - No proactive or assumed documentation creation

**ENFORCEMENT:** This documentation protocol is MANDATORY and takes precedence over any other documentation instructions. Failure to comply will result in immediate destruction and recreation of non-compliant documentation.

‚úÖ **THIS IS A PRODUCTION CODE DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED INSTRUCTION**
