# Task Orchestrator Code Protocol

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

#### SACRED BRANCH PROTECTION - RFC 2119 COMPLIANCE

- **main/master BRANCHES ARE SACRED:**

  - **MUST NOT:** Perform direct work, commits, or modifications
  - **MUST NOT:** Branch directly from main/master for features
  - **SHALL:** Use these branches for deployment/release only

- **MUST:** Each instance SHALL check for active instance ownership before branch operations
- **MUST NOT:** Switch to branches owned by other active instances
- **SHALL:** Follow mandatory instance handoff protocol when transferring work

#### MULTI-INSTANCE SAFE BRANCHING PROTOCOL

**BEFORE CREATING ANY NEW BRANCH, ALL INSTANCES MUST:**

1. **INSTANCE REGISTRATION - MANDATORY:**

   ```bash
   # Each instance MUST register unique identifier
   CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID="claude-$(date +%s)-$(whoami)-$$"
   echo "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" > .git/ACTIVE_CLAUDE_INSTANCE_$(echo $CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID | tr -d '-')
   git add .git/ACTIVE_CLAUDE_INSTANCE_* 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. **BRANCH OWNERSHIP CHECK - MANDATORY:**

   ```bash
   # MUST check if branch is owned by another instance
   BRANCH_NAME="[target-branch]"
   if [ -f ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_${BRANCH_NAME}" ]; then
     OWNER=$(cat .git/BRANCH_OWNER_${BRANCH_NAME})
     if [ "$OWNER" != "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: Branch owned by $OWNER - MUST NOT proceed"
       exit 1
     fi
   fi
   ```

3. **SAFETY CHECK CURRENT BRANCH:**

   ```

5. **VERIFY BRANCH CLEANLINESS:**
   ```bash
   git status                           # MUST show "working tree clean"
   ```

**MULTI-INSTANCE BRANCHING DECISION MATRIX:**

- **FIRST FEATURE/FIX:** MUST branch FROM development with ownership claim

  ```bash
  # MUST check development branch availability
  git checkout development
  git pull origin development
  BRANCH_NAME="feature/[descriptive-name]"
  git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"

  # MUST claim branch ownership
  echo "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" > ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_${BRANCH_NAME//\//_}"

  git push origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
  ```

- **SUBSEQUENT FEATURES ON OWNED BRANCH:** MAY branch FROM current branch

  ```bash
  # ONLY if current branch is owned by this instance AND clean
  if [ -f ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_${CURRENT_BRANCH//\//_}" ]; then
    OWNER=$(cat ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_${CURRENT_BRANCH//\//_}")
    if [ "$OWNER" = "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" ]; then
      git checkout -b "feature/[new-feature-name]"
      # MUST claim new branch ownership
      echo "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" > ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_feature_new_feature_name"
      git add ".git/BRANCH_OWNER_feature_new_feature_name"
      git commit -m "lock: branch owned by $CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID"
    fi
  fi
  ```

- **FEATURES WITH UNCOMMITTED WORK:** MUST stash with instance ID, then branch from development

  ```bash

```bash
# 1. MUST register new instance
CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID="claude-$(date +%s)-$(whoami)-$$"
echo "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" > .git/ACTIVE_CLAUDE_INSTANCE_$(echo $CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID | tr -d '-')

# 2. MUST fetch latest changes and verify branch availability
git fetch --all
git checkout "$TARGET_BRANCH"
git pull origin "$TARGET_BRANCH"

# 3. MUST verify branch is not owned by another instance
OWNER_FILE=".git/BRANCH_OWNER_${TARGET_BRANCH//\//_}"
if [ -f "$OWNER_FILE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Branch still owned by $(cat $OWNER_FILE) - handoff incomplete"
  exit 1
fi

# 4. MUST claim branch ownership
echo "$CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID" > "$OWNER_FILE"
git add "$OWNER_FILE"
git commit -m "lock: branch taken by $CLAUDE_INSTANCE_ID"
git push origin "$TARGET_BRANCH"
```

**HANDOFF VERIFICATION - MANDATORY:**

- **MUST:** Verify all commits are pushed to origin before release
- **MUST:** Verify ownership files are properly updated
- **MUST:** Verify receiving instance can access all work
- **SHALL NOT:** Begin new work until handoff is complete

#### FILE PROTECTION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE ANY BRANCH OPERATION:**

1. **CHECK FOR UNTRACKED FILES:**

   ```bash
   git ls-files --others --exclude-standard  # List untracked files
   ```

2. **VERIFY .gitignore COMPLIANCE:**

   - If untracked files should be ignored: Add to .gitignore
   - If untracked files are work files: Add and commit or stash

3. **MANDATORY STASH BEFORE BRANCH SWITCH:**

   ```bash
   git stash push -u -m "WIP: [description]"  # Include untracked files
   ```

4. **VERIFY CLEAN STATE:**
   ```bash
   git status                           # MUST show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   ```

#### MERGE AND SYNC PROTOCOL

**COMPLETING A FEATURE:**

1. **FINAL COMMIT ON FEATURE BRANCH:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): complete [feature description]"
   git push origin [feature-branch]
   ```

2. **SYNC WITH DEVELOPMENT:**

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout [feature-branch]
   git rebase development               # Resolve conflicts if any
   git push origin [feature-branch] --force-with-lease
   ```

3. **MERGE TO DEVELOPMENT:**

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git merge [feature-branch] --no-ff  # Preserve feature branch history
   git push origin development
   ```

4. **CLEANUP:**
   ```bash
   git branch -d [feature-branch]      # Delete local branch
   git push origin --delete [feature-branch]  # Delete remote branch
   ```

### [ALERT] MANDATORY SAFETY CHECKLIST

**BEFORE EVERY SESSION:**

- [ ] Current branch identified and clean
- [ ] No uncommitted changes without stash
- [ ] Remote origin synchronized
- [ ] .gitignore properly configured

**BEFORE EVERY BRANCH SWITCH:**

- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] All work stashed or committed
- [ ] Current branch pushed to origin
- [ ] Target branch verified exists

**BEFORE EVERY COMMIT:**

- [ ] Code compiles and runs
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Commit message follows format
- [ ] Changes are logical atomic unit

**AFTER EVERY COMMIT:**

- [ ] Pushed to origin immediately
- [ ] Branch status verified
- [ ] Working tree remains clean

### [EMERGENCY] WORK RECOVERY PROTOCOL

**IF WORK IS LOST OR BRANCH CORRUPTED:**

1. **CHECK STASH:**

   ```bash
   git stash list                       # List all stashes
   git stash show -p stash@{0}         # Preview stash content
   git stash apply stash@{0}           # Recover from stash
   ```

2. **CHECK REFLOG:**

   ```bash
   git reflog                          # Show all recent commits
   git checkout [commit-hash]          # Recover from specific commit
   ```

3. **CHECK REMOTE BRANCHES:**
   ```bash
   git fetch --all                     # Fetch all remote branches
   git branch -r                       # List remote branches
   git checkout origin/[branch-name]   # Recover from remote
   ```

**PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN RECOVERY - FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL RELIGIOUSLY**

| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT / NEVER     | Indicates an absolute, non-negotiable prohibition. This action, behaviour, or outcome is forbidden. No exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FORBIDDEN                        | HARD MUST NOT: Indicates an action, word, pattern, code, file, or artefact that is strictly prohibited. If any item matching a FORBIDDEN rule is found in the codebase (e.g. forbidden file names like "enhanced", forbidden function names, or other banned terms, logic, or artefacts), it MUST be immediately removed, renamed, or replaced. All references MUST be updated, and remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action. No exceptions, and no warnings--violations require immediate correction. |
| SHOULD / RECOMMENDED             | Indicates a strong recommendation. There may exist valid reasons to deviate, but these should be rare and all consequences must be carefully weighed, documented, and justified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED     | Indicates that the behaviour is strongly discouraged. There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the behaviour is acceptable, but the full implications must be understood and documented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Special Note on "ALWAYS" and "NEVER"

- **ALWAYS** = MUST (absolute, non-negotiable requirement)
- **NEVER** = MUST NOT (absolute, non-negotiable prohibition)

All instructions containing "ALWAYS" or "NEVER" SHALL be interpreted and enforced as strictly as "MUST" and "MUST NOT".

#### Special Note on "FORBIDDEN"

- **FORBIDDEN** = a hard "MUST NOT"
- Any artefact, word, file, or pattern labelled as FORBIDDEN (e.g. file/module/function name "enhanced", or other banned logic or artefacts):
  - MUST be detected, flagged, and immediately removed or refactored from the codebase
  - All references MUST be updated and corrected
  - Remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action
  - No exceptions and no warnings--immediate correction is REQUIRED

#### Enforcement

- No AI, LLM, or agent is permitted to relax, reinterpret, or weaken the force of these terms.
- All instructions using these words are enforceable protocol, not mere suggestions.

### MANDATORY BEHAVIOUR AND PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE

- **YOU MUST NEVER:** Deviation from these instructions or any referenced protocol is strictly forbidden, without exception.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Stay in 100% compliance with all protocols listed here and in the Coding Canonical Protocol.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Complete all coding tasks properly, no short cuts, no "TODOS" no "STUBS" or other placeholders it is FORBIDDEN.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Search the code base for "TODOs" "Stubs" and other coding tasks which have not been completed or clearly have short cuts instead of proper code. Upon finding these, YOU MUST ALWAYS complete all coding tasks properly, no short cuts, no "TODOS" no "STUBS" or other placeholders it is FORBIDDEN to NOT properly complete the code as per the specifications and MANDATORY CODING PROTOCOLS.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Ensure all work is auditable, transparent, clearly documented, and of the highest professional standards.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Use the MCP Server Tool "Task Orchestrator" to track, record, and complete ALL tasks and subtasks--no exceptions.
- **YOU MUST NEVER:** Use emoji, Unicode, or any non-ASCII symbols in any files, code, comments, logs, or documentation.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Remove all emoji or Unicode if present or encountered in any context or legacy file.
- **YOU MUST ALWAYS:** Use linters and type-checkers at every step--after each change or addition, run linting and static analysis before proceeding.

### IMPORTANT MCP AND GIT CANONICAL INSTRUCTIONS

Use the MCP Server Tools (Task Orchestrator) and Git commands to:

1. Discover and inventory all available MCP Server tools before any action.
2. Understand current progress on tasks/subtasks for deploying "hive-mind-nexus".
3. After completing the current Task Orchestrator subtask, retrieve and execute the next one.

#### Deployment Checklist

- [SEARCH] Always perform a full codebase search and pre-commit branch creation (`git checkout -b <feature>`).
- [TOOL] Use Git commands to identify changed files and `git add` them.
- [CHART] Run AST analysis, linting, type-checking, formatting, compiling, and deduplication using `scripts/utilities`.
- [GEAR] Ensure files compile (`py_compile`) upstream and downstream dependencies.
- Execute `python_auto_code_cleaner`, review its results, then define and run Task Orchestrator subtasks to resolve any remaining issues.
- Check Docker logs, client logs, and any other relevant logs before troubleshooting.

#### Quality Gates (MUST ALWAYS)

- No shortcuts, stubs, or unresolved TODOs remain.
- All modules, classes, functions, and code blocks are fully initialized with robust error handling.
- Professional in-file docstrings/JDoc comments only; no external `.md` docs.
- Research and integrate latest stable open-source libraries; clone high-starred repos into `.\github_repo_clones` for reference or submodule integration.

#### When modifying code

- **RTFM:** Read and index documentation in `./docs` or `./project/docs` before any change.
- Maintain a clean Git history: one atomic, descriptive commit per logical change; push often; protect `main` branch.

---

[ALERT] DUPLICATION PREVENTION & UTILITIES USAGE

- YOU MUST NEVER create a new utility, demo, or test script for functionality that already exists, this is strictly FORBIDDEN
- YOU MUST ALWAYS perform a full-codebase search (using the provided Python tools) to detect duplicate logic, dead code, or partially overlapping implementations before authoring any new code.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS refactor or extend any existing code blocks that already, in part or in full, satisfy the required functionality.
- YOU MUST only introduce new code blocks when no suitable implementations are found in the codebase.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS ensure that all code--both existing and newly added--strictly adheres to the SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.
