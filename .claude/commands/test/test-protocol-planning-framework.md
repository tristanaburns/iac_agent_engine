# === Universal Code Test Planning Framework: AI-Driven Test Strategy and Framework Development Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**
1. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/ai-agent-compliance.md`
2. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/core/code-protocol-compliance-prompt.md`
3. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/test/test-protocol-service-examples.md`
4. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
5. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**
- Making large, non-atomic changes
- Skipping tests or validation

- Proceeding without understanding
- Creating duplicate functionality
- Using outdated patterns

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **NO MOCKING** of data or services in production code
- **NO TODOs** - complete ALL work immediately
- **NO SHORTCUTS** - implement properly ALWAYS
- **NO STUBS** - write complete implementations
- **NO FIXED DATA** - use real, dynamic data
- **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - use configuration
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - fix root causes
- **NO FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - real code only
- **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - production-ready only
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS** - permanent fixes only

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS:**
   - Search for .ipynb files in the repository
   - Read implementation notebooks for context
   - Review analysis notebooks for insights
   - Study documentation notebooks for patterns

2. **READ PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:**
   - Check `./docs` directory thoroughly
   - Check `./project/docs` if it exists
   - Read ALL README files
   - Review architecture documentation
   - Study API documentation

3. **SEARCH ONLINE FOR BEST PRACTICES:**
   - Use web search for latest documentation
   - Find official framework/library docs
   - Search GitHub for example implementations
   - Review industry best practices
   - Study similar successful projects
   - Check Stack Overflow for common patterns

**SEARCH PRIORITIES:**
- Official documentation (latest version)
- GitHub repositories with high stars
- Industry standard implementations
- Recent blog posts/tutorials (< 1 year old)
- Community best practices

## **MCP PROMPT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**: This is an MCP-compliant prompt that must be executed according to Model Context Protocol standards.

### **TEST-PLANNING-FRAMEWORK-ONLY MANDATE - CRITICAL DISTINCTION**

**THIS COMMAND IS FOR TEST PLANNING FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT ONLY:**

- **MUST:** Implement comprehensive test planning frameworks and templates

- **FORBIDDEN:** Execute ANY actual test implementations or system changes
- **FORBIDDEN:** Modify ANY production systems or test configurations
- **FORBIDDEN:** Create ANY new test cases or test executions
- **MUST:** Output planning framework results in Jupyter notebooks with timestamp tracking

**TEST PLANNING FRAMEWORK FOCUS AREAS:**

- Test strategy development frameworks and methodologies
- Comprehensive feature analysis and planning templates
- Test coverage analysis and planning matrices
- Risk assessment and priority planning frameworks
- Resource planning and timeline development tools
- Quality framework and success criteria definition
- Test automation strategy and planning frameworks

### **EXECUTION SEQUENCE:**

1. **LOAD MCP PROMPT**: Execute the MCP prompt defined in `test-protocol-planning-framework-prompt.yaml`
2. **PROVIDE ARGUMENTS**: Supply required arguments for framework_scope, methodology_depth, template_complexity
3. **FOLLOW PROTOCOL**: Execute all phases according to the planning framework protocol specifications
4. **VERIFY COMPLETION**: Ensure all planning framework objectives and template criteria have been met
5. **DOCUMENT RESULTS**: Create comprehensive planning framework documentation with timestamps
6. **VALIDATE COMPLIANCE**: Confirm 100% planning framework development and template completeness achieved

### **MCP PROMPT INVOCATION:**

**ENFORCEMENT:** This command performs TEST PLANNING FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT ONLY through the MCP prompt protocol. The comprehensive framework logic is defined in `test-protocol-planning-framework-prompt.yaml` and executed according to Model Context Protocol standards. No actual test planning or system changes are performed. Use `/test-planning` for actual planning implementation after frameworks are developed.
