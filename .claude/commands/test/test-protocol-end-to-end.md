## Integration Test Patterns

### Pattern 1: Service Chain Validation
```python
def test_service_chain():
    """Test complete service chain integration"""

    # Step 1: Create workflow in n8n
    workflow_id = create_n8n_workflow({
        "name": "Test Workflow",
        "nodes": ["webhook", "transform", "database"]
    })

    # Step 2: Execute workflow
    execution_id = execute_workflow(workflow_id, test_data)

    # Step 3: Verify PostgreSQL state
    assert verify_postgresql_state(execution_id) == "completed"

    # Step 4: Check Neo4j graph
    assert verify_neo4j_nodes(workflow_id) > 0

    # Step 5: Validate Prometheus metrics
    assert get_prometheus_metric("workflow_execution_total") > 0

    # Step 6: Verify Grafana dashboard
    assert verify_grafana_panel("workflow_metrics") == "active"
```

### Pattern 2: Data Consistency Validation
```python
def test_data_consistency():
    """Validate data consistency across all storage systems"""

    test_record = {
        "id": "test_123",
        "data": "test_data",
        "timestamp": datetime.now()
    }

    # Store in PostgreSQL
    pg_id = store_postgresql(test_record)

    # Create Neo4j node
    neo4j_node = create_neo4j_node(test_record)

    # Generate and store vector
    vector = generate_embedding(test_record["data"])
    qdrant_id = store_qdrant_vector(vector, test_record["id"])

    # Store artifact in MinIO
    minio_url = store_minio_artifact(test_record)

    # Verify consistency
    assert postgresql_get(pg_id) == test_record
    assert neo4j_get_node(neo4j_node) == test_record
    assert qdrant_search(vector)[0]["id"] == test_record["id"]
    assert minio_get(minio_url)["data"] == test_record["data"]
```

        results = []

        # Phase 1: Service Health Checks
        for service in self.services:
            assert self.health_check(service), f"{service} not healthy"

        # Phase 2: Execute Test Scenarios
        for scenario in self.test_suite:
            result = self.execute_scenario(scenario)
            results.append(result)

        # Phase 3: Validate Results
        self.validate_results(results)

        # Phase 4: Generate Report
        return self.generate_report(results)

        for step in scenario.steps:
            self.execute_step(step)
            self.validate_step(step)
