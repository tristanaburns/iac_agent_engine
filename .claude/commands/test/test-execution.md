# === Universal Test Execution: AI-Driven Comprehensive Test Implementation and Results Analysis Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**

1. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/ai-agent-compliance.md`
2. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/core/code-protocol-compliance-prompt.md`
3. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/test/test-protocol-execution-tracking.md`
4. **READ AND INDEX**: `.claude/commands/test/test-protocol-service-examples.md`
5. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
6. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**

- Executing tests without proper planning validation

- **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - use configured test parameters
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - fix actual test failures properly
- **NO FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - real test execution only
- **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - production-ready test execution
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS** - permanent test result analysis

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ TEST EXECUTION DOCUMENTATION:**

   - Read `TEST_PLAN_FRAMEWORK.md` for execution methodology
   - Review `PLATFORM_TEST_PLAN.md` for platform procedures
