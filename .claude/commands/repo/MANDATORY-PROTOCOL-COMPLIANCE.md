# === MANDATORY PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE FOR ALL REPO COMMANDS ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION MUST BE READ AND INDEXED BEFORE ANY REPO CLEANUP EXECUTION**

### MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

Before executing ANY repository cleanup command, YOU MUST:

1. **READ AND INDEX** the code protocol file:

   ```
   ./.claude/commands/core/code-protocol.md
   ```

2. **SPECIFICALLY INDEX** these critical sections:

   - `THE [STRONG] Coding Canonical Protocol`
   - `MANDATORY BEHAVIOUR AND PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE`
   - `REQUIREMENTS LANGUAGE PROTOCOL`
   - `CANONICAL CODING PHILOSOPHY`
   - `IMPORTANT CANONICAL INSTRUCTIONS`

3. **ACKNOWLEDGE AND COMPLY** with:
   - RFC 2119 requirements language (MUST/SHALL/FORBIDDEN)
   - User control requirements (wait for explicit permission)
   - RTFM requirements (read docs BEFORE acting)
   - No Unicode/emoji policy
   - Atomic operations requirements
   - Git best practices

### RTFM ENFORCEMENT

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. READ documentation in `./docs` and `./project/docs` FIRST
2. UPDATE documentation if it doesn't match code
3. MAINTAIN up-to-date documentation
4. NEVER act without reading manuals first

### CANONICAL CODING PHILOSOPHY ENFORCEMENT

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. ENSURE code uniformity across entire codebase
2. APPLY KISS principles without exception
3. APPLY SOLID principles without exception
4. APPLY DRY principles without exception
5. APPLY Clean Code principles without exception

### USER PERMISSION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE ANY ACTION:**

- Does user want me to act NOW? If no: STOP
- Has user given explicit command? If no: WAIT
- Am I about to ask "should I proceed?" FORBIDDEN - WAIT

### FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:**

- Act without explicit user instruction
- Make changes without reading documentation
- Create duplicate code or files
- Use emoji or Unicode characters
- Skip linting or type checking
- Leave TODOs or incomplete code
- Create files with "fix", "clean", "final", "updated" in names

### COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

Before proceeding with cleanup:

- [ ] Have you READ `./.claude/commands/core/code-protocol-compliance-prompt.md`?
- [ ] Have you INDEXED all required protocol sections?
- [ ] Have you CHECKED existing documentation?
- [ ] Have you VERIFIED user permission to act?
- [ ] Have you PLANNED atomic operations?
- [ ] Have you PREPARED rollback strategy?

### ENFORCEMENT CONSEQUENCES

**PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS REQUIRE:**

1. IMMEDIATE STOP
2. ACKNOWLEDGE violation
3. AWAIT further instruction
4. NO proceeding until compliance verified
