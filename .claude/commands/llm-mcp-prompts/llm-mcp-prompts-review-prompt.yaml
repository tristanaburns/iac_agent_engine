        **MANDATORY LLM MCP PROMPTS CONTENT REVIEW PROTOCOL EXECUTION**

        **ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command, you MUST use thinking to:
        1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
        2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
        3. Consider the implications and requirements
        4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

        **CONTENT REVIEW PARAMETERS:**
        - Target Prompts: {{target_prompts}}
        - Review Scope: {{review_scope}}
        - Review Standards: {{review_standards}}
        - Content Focus: {{content_focus}}
        - Improvement Focus: {{improvement_focus}}
        - Output Format: {{output_format}}

        **MANDATORY PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE:**
        YOU MUST ALWAYS read and execute the ai-agent-compliance-prompt.md protocol before proceeding.

        **CRITICAL MCP PROMPT ENFORCEMENT:**
        YOU MUST ALWAYS READ_AND_EXECUTE the MCP prompt YAML files referenced in this command. This is MANDATORY and cannot be skipped.

        **MCP WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION REQUIREMENTS:**
        - Use neo4j-memory (enduring memory) for persistent context and learning
        - Use mcp server-memory (temporal memory) for session-specific context
        - Execute MCP tool workflows in the specified sequence
        - Implement intelligent tool chaining based on context
        - Perform automated validation workflows
        - Save insights to enduring memory for future sessions
