# === Code Planning: AI-Driven Exhaustive Implementation Blueprint ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ AND EXECUTE**: `.claude/commands/ai-agent-compliance-prompt.md`
2. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance-prompt.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**

- Making large, non-atomic changes
- Skipping tests or validation
- Ignoring build/deploy errors
- Proceeding without understanding
- Creating duplicate functionality
- Using outdated patterns

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

- **NO MOCKING** of data or services in production code
- **NO TODOs** - complete ALL work immediately
- **NO SHORTCUTS** - implement properly ALWAYS
- **NO STUBS** - write complete implementations
- **NO FIXED DATA** - use real, dynamic data
- **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - use configuration
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - fix root causes
- **NO FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - real code only
- **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - production-ready only
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS** - permanent fixes only

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS:**

   - Search for .ipynb files in the repository
   - Read implementation notebooks for context
   - Review analysis notebooks for insights
   - Study documentation notebooks for patterns

2. **READ PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:**

   - Check `./docs` directory thoroughly
   - Check `./project/docs` if it exists
   - Read ALL README files
   - Review architecture documentation
   - Study API documentation

3. **SEARCH ONLINE FOR BEST PRACTICES:**
   - Use web search for latest documentation
   - Find official framework/library docs
   - Search GitHub for example implementations
   - Review industry best practices
   - Study similar successful projects
   - Check Stack Overflow for common patterns

**SEARCH PRIORITIES:**

- Official documentation (latest version)
- GitHub repositories with high stars
- Industry standard implementations
- Recent blog posts/tutorials (< 1 year old)
- Community best practices

## **MCP PROMPT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**: This is an MCP-compliant prompt that must be executed according to Model Context Protocol standards.

### **PLANNING-ONLY MANDATE - CRITICAL DISTINCTION**

**THIS COMMAND IS FOR CODE PLANNING ONLY:**

- **MUST:** Create exhaustive implementation blueprints
- **MUST:** Scan existing codebase for reuse opportunities
- **MUST:** Design architecture following SOLID, DRY, KISS
- **MUST:** Plan comprehensive debug logging strategy
- **MUST:** Design complete validation workflows
- **FORBIDDEN:** Planning test implementation (separate task)
- **FORBIDDEN:** Creating implementation details or actual code
- **FORBIDDEN:** Planning external documentation
- **MUST:** Output planning documentation in Jupyter notebooks

**PLANNING FOCUS AREAS:**

- Requirements analysis and code reuse discovery
- Architecture design with SOLID principles
- Debug logging strategy planning
- Technical design and data architecture
- Implementation blueprint creation
- Validation workflow design
- Deployment and operational planning

### **EXECUTION SEQUENCE:**

1. **LOAD MCP PROMPT**: Execute the MCP prompt defined in `code-planning-prompt.yaml`
2. **PROVIDE ARGUMENTS**: Supply required arguments for planning_target and optional parameters
3. **FOLLOW PROTOCOL**: Execute all phases according to the planning protocol specifications
4. **VERIFY COMPLETION**: Ensure all objectives and outcomes have been met
5. **DOCUMENT RESULTS**: Create comprehensive planning documentation
6. **VALIDATE COMPLIANCE**: Confirm 100% planning completeness achieved

### **MCP PROMPT INVOCATION:**

```yaml
# Use this MCP prompt with required arguments:
prompt_name: "code-planning-prompt"
arguments:
  planning_target: "[feature|bugfix|optimization to plan]"
  planning_scope: "[optional: comprehensive|feature-specific|bugfix|etc.]"
  existing_codebase: "[optional: path to codebase for reuse analysis]"
  complexity_level: "[optional: simple|moderate|complex|enterprise]"
  validation_requirements: "[optional: standard|comprehensive|strict|continuous]"
  deployment_target: "[optional: local|dev|staging|production|multi-env]"
```

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] MCP prompt executed with proper arguments and date stamps
- [ ] All planning phases completed according to protocol with timestamp tracking
- [ ] 100% comprehensive implementation blueprint created
- [ ] Complete code reuse analysis performed (timestamped)
- [ ] Architecture designed with SOLID principles (timestamped)
- [ ] Debug logging strategy planned (timestamped)
- [ ] Validation workflow designed (timestamped)
- [ ] Deployment plan created (timestamped)
- [ ] All deliverables produced as specified in YAML protocol with proper timestamps

### **MANDATORY DATE STAMP REQUIREMENTS:**

**ALL PLANNING OUTPUT FILES MUST USE REVERSE DATE STAMP FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS**

- [ ] All planning deliverables (.ipynb) have reverse date stamps in filenames
- [ ] All blueprint documentation includes precise timestamps
- [ ] All architecture designs include timestamp documentation
- [ ] All validation workflows include proper date stamps
- [ ] All deployment plans follow consistent date stamp format
- [ ] UTC time used for all timestamp operations

**FORBIDDEN:**

- Creating planning files without proper reverse date stamps
- Using inconsistent date formats within same planning session
- Missing timestamps in planning documentation

### **PLANNING DELIVERABLES WITH REVERSE DATE STAMPS:**

**MANDATORY JUPYTER NOTEBOOK DELIVERABLES:**

1. **`./project/docs/planning/code-planning/Implementation_Plan_{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.ipynb`** - Complete implementation details with all components and modules
2. **`./project/docs/planning/code-planning/Testing_Strategy_{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.ipynb`** - Test execution results, coverage analysis, and validation
3. **`./project/docs/planning/code-planning/Integration_Plan_{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.ipynb`** - Integration patterns, dependencies, and implementation
4. **`./project/docs/planning/code-planning/Deployment_Plan_{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.ipynb`** - Deployment architecture, strategy, and SOLID compliance review

**ENFORCEMENT:** This command performs CODE PLANNING ONLY through the MCP prompt protocol. The comprehensive planning logic is defined in `code-planning-prompt.yaml` and executed according to Model Context Protocol standards.
