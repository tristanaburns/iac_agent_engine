# Architecture Microservices Design Command

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**
1. **READ AND INDEX**: `C:\github_development\ai-agents\.claude\commands\ai-agent-compliance.md`
2. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance.md requirements and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**
- Making large, non-atomic changes
- Skipping tests or validation
- Ignoring build/deploy errors
- Proceeding without understanding
- Creating duplicate functionality
- Using outdated patterns

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **NO MOCKING** of data or services in production code
- **NO TODOs** - complete ALL work immediately
- **NO SHORTCUTS** - implement properly ALWAYS
- **NO STUBS** - write complete implementations
- **NO FIXED DATA** - use real, dynamic data
- **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - use configuration
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - fix root causes
- **NO FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS** - real code only
- **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - production-ready only
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS** - permanent fixes only

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS:**
   - Search for .ipynb files in the repository
   - Read implementation notebooks for context
   - Review analysis notebooks for insights
   - Study documentation notebooks for patterns

2. **READ PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:**
   - Check `./docs` directory thoroughly
   - Check `./project/docs` if it exists
   - Read ALL README files
   - Review architecture documentation
   - Study API documentation

3. **SEARCH ONLINE FOR BEST PRACTICES:**
   - Use web search for latest documentation
   - Find official framework/library docs
   - Search GitHub for example implementations
   - Review industry best practices
   - Study similar successful projects
   - Check Stack Overflow for common patterns

**SEARCH PRIORITIES:**
- Official documentation (latest version)
- GitHub repositories with high stars
- Industry standard implementations
- Recent blog posts/tutorials (< 1 year old)
- Community best practices

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Service Decomposition & Boundaries

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "API Gateway Layer"
        AG[Kong/Traefik/Nginx]
    end

    subgraph "Service Mesh"
        SM[Istio/Linkerd/Consul]
    end

    subgraph "Core Services"
        US[User Service]
        AS[Auth Service]
        PS[Product Service]
        OS[Order Service]
        NS[Notification Service]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        UD[(User DB)]
        PD[(Product DB)]
        OD[(Order DB)]
        C[(Redis Cache)]
        Q[RabbitMQ/Kafka]
    end

    AG --> SM
    SM --> US & AS & PS & OS & NS
    US --> UD
    PS --> PD
    OS --> OD
    US & PS & OS --> C
    OS --> Q --> NS
```

**Required Documentation:**
- Service boundaries following DDD bounded contexts
- Service contracts and API specifications (OpenAPI 3.0)
- Data ownership and consistency boundaries
- Service dependencies and coupling analysis
- Autonomous service criteria checklist

### 2. 12-Factor App Compliance

#### Factor Checklist and Implementation
```mermaid
mindmap
  root((12-Factor App))
    Codebase
      Git monorepo
      Service subdirectories
      Shared libraries
    Dependencies
      Package managers
      Container images
      Dependency isolation
    Config
      Environment variables
      ConfigMaps/Secrets
      External configuration
    Backing Services
      Database connections
      Message queues
      Cache services
    Build/Release/Run
      CI/CD pipelines
      Container registry
      Immutable releases
    Processes
      Stateless services
      Horizontal scaling

- [ ] VII. Port binding - Export services via port binding
- [ ] VIII. Concurrency - Scale out via the process model
- [ ] IX. Disposability - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
- [ ] X. Dev/prod parity - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
- [ ] XI. Logs - Treat logs as event streams
- [ ] XII. Admin processes - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

### 3. Cloud Native Architecture Patterns

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Cloud Native Microservices Architecture

    Person(user, "User", "Service consumer")

    System_Boundary(cdn, "CDN") {
        Container(cloudflare, "Cloudflare", "CDN", "Global edge caching")
    }

    System_Boundary(k8s, "Kubernetes Cluster") {
        Container(ingress, "Ingress Controller", "NGINX", "Load balancing & SSL termination")
        Container(gateway, "API Gateway", "Kong", "Rate limiting, auth, routing")
        Container(mesh, "Service Mesh", "Istio", "Service discovery, observability")

        System_Boundary(services, "Microservices") {
            Container(auth, "Auth Service", "Go", "JWT authentication")
            Container(user, "User Service", "Node.js", "User management")
            Container(product, "Product Service", "Java", "Product catalog")
            Container(order, "Order Service", "Python", "Order processing")
        }

        System_Boundary(data, "Data Stores") {
            ContainerDb(postgres, "PostgreSQL", "RDBMS", "Transactional data")
            ContainerDb(mongo, "MongoDB", "NoSQL", "Product catalog")
            ContainerDb(redis, "Redis", "Cache", "Session & cache")
            ContainerQueue(kafka, "Kafka", "Event Stream", "Event backbone")
        }
    }

    Rel(user, cloudflare, "HTTPS")
    Rel(cloudflare, ingress, "HTTPS")
    Rel(ingress, gateway, "HTTP")
    Rel(gateway, mesh, "gRPC/HTTP")
    Rel(mesh, services, "gRPC/HTTP")
    Rel(services, data, "TCP")
```

**Required Patterns:**
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- API gateway for external access
- Circuit breakers and retry patterns
- Distributed tracing and observability
- Health checks and self-healing

### 4. Domain-Driven Design Integration

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Bounded Context"
        UE[User Entity]
        UR[User Repository]
        US[User Service]
        UD[User Domain Events]
    end

    subgraph "Order Bounded Context"
        OE[Order Entity]
        OR[Order Repository]
        OS[Order Service]
        OD[Order Domain Events]
    end

    subgraph "Product Bounded Context"
        PE[Product Entity]
        PR[Product Repository]
        PS[Product Service]
        PD[Product Domain Events]
    end

    subgraph "Event Bus"
        EB[Kafka/RabbitMQ]
    end

    UD --> EB

    RESTful API following:
    - REST maturity level 3 (HATEOAS)
    - JSON:API or HAL specification
    - Versioning strategy (URL/Header)
    - Rate limiting headers
    - Correlation ID tracking
servers:

    participant Notification Service

    Client->>API Gateway: POST /orders
    API Gateway->>Order Service: Create Order
    Order Service->>Event Bus: OrderCreated Event

    par Async Processing
        Event Bus->>Inventory Service: OrderCreated
        Inventory Service->>Event Bus: InventoryReserved
    and
        Event Bus->>Payment Service: OrderCreated
        Payment Service->>Event Bus: PaymentProcessed
    end

    Event Bus->>Order Service: InventoryReserved
    Event Bus->>Order Service: PaymentProcessed

        S1[Service A]
        S2[Service B]
        S3[Service C]
    end

    S1 & S2 & S3 --> OT
    OT --> J
    S1 & S2 & S3 --> F
    F --> E --> K
    I --> P --> G
```

**Observability Requirements:**
