# === Universal Kubernetes Architecture Design: Enterprise-Grade Architecture & Patterns Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ AND EXECUTE**: `.claude/commands/ai-agent-compliance-prompt.md`
2. **READ AND COMPLY**: `.claude/commands/deployments/DEPLOYMENT-STRUCTURE.md`
3. **VERIFY**: User has given explicit permission to proceed
4. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**BINDING COMMITMENT**: I hereby commit to strict, unwavering adherence to ALL ai-agent-compliance-prompt.md requirements and DEPLOYMENT-STRUCTURE.md compliance, and will halt operations immediately upon any protocol violation to perform mandatory root cause analysis and corrective action.

**FORBIDDEN**: Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification and mandatory structure adherence

## KISS PRINCIPLES MANDATE

**KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID) PRINCIPLES ARE MANDATORY:**

- Design simple, straightforward architectures over complex ones
- Use standard Kubernetes resources over custom resources
- Create clear, readable architecture diagrams and documentation
- Implement proven patterns and established practices
- Design for maintainability and operational simplicity
- Avoid over-engineering unless absolutely necessary
- Choose clarity over cleverness in all architectural decisions
- Use well-established industry patterns and practices

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

**FORBIDDEN PRACTICES:**

- Creating overly complex architectures
- Using non-standard or experimental patterns without justification
- Designing without security-first approach
- Ignoring universal platform compatibility
- Creating incomplete architecture documentation
- Designing without operational considerations
- Deviating from mandatory structure
- Over-engineering simple solutions

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

- **NO EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES** - use production-ready, stable patterns only
- **NO SHORTCUTS** - design comprehensive architectures ALWAYS
- **NO INCOMPLETE DESIGNS** - create complete, production-ready architectures
- **NO PLATFORM LOCK-IN** - design for universal platform compatibility
- **NO SECURITY AFTERTHOUGHTS** - implement security-first design
- **NO HARDCODED CONFIGURATIONS** - use parameterized, environment-agnostic designs
- **NO MONOLITHIC THINKING** - design for microservices and modularity
- **NO DOCUMENTATION GAPS** - comprehensive documentation MANDATORY
- **NO STRUCTURE DEVIATIONS** - follow mandatory structure exactly
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING** - use KISS principles always

## RTFM (READ THE FUCKING MANUAL) - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

1. **READ MANDATORY STRUCTURE DOCUMENT:**

   - Read `.claude/commands/deployments/DEPLOYMENT-STRUCTURE.md` thoroughly
   - Understand every directory and file requirement for architecture compliance
   - Follow the structure exactly without deviations in all designs

2. **READ DEPLOYMENT TEMPLATES:**

   - Study `K8S-DEPLOYMENT-TEMPLATES.md` for proven patterns
   - Understand microservices, web application, and database patterns
   - Apply template patterns consistently across architectures

3. **SEARCH ONLINE FOR BEST PRACTICES:**
   - Use web search for latest Kubernetes architecture patterns
   - Find CNCF landscape and graduated project patterns
   - Search for production-grade microservices architectures
   - Review service mesh patterns (Istio, Linkerd, Consul)
   - Study ingress controller best practices
   - Check cloud-native security patterns

**SEARCH PRIORITIES:**

- CNCF graduated project documentation and patterns
- Kubernetes official documentation (latest version)
- Cloud provider reference architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Service mesh official documentation and patterns
- Production-grade open source project architectures
- Industry case studies and success patterns

# Validate mandatory structure compliance
conftest verify --policy structure-compliance/ architecture-patterns/
```

**Architecture Documentation Validation:**

```bash
# Validate architecture documentation completeness

---

**ENFORCEMENT:** This command performs COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ONLY through the MCP prompt protocol with STRICT adherence to KISS principles and DEPLOYMENT-STRUCTURE.md. The comprehensive architecture logic is defined in `deployments-k8s-architecture-prompt.yaml` and executed according to Model Context Protocol standards. No actual deployment actions are taken. All architecture designs must follow the mandatory directory structure exactly and incorporate universal platform compatibility. Use `/deployments-planning` for detailed planning after architecture approval, then `/deployments-implement` for actual deployment execution. Focus on creating production-ready, universally deployable Kubernetes architectures with comprehensive documentation and proper timestamp tracking.
