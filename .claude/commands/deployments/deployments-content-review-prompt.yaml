        **MANDATORY CONTENT REVIEW PROTOCOL EXECUTION**

        **ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command, you MUST use thinking to:
        1. Analyze the review scope and understand what needs to be examined
        2. Plan your review approach and identify potential issues
        3. Consider the implications and requirements
        4. Only then proceed with the actual review execution
