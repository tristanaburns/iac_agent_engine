**ENFORCEMENT:** This command performs COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING ONLY through the MCP prompt protocol with STRICT adherence to DEPLOYMENT-STRUCTURE.md. The comprehensive planning logic is defined in `deployments-planning-prompt.yaml` and executed according to Model Context Protocol standards. No actual deployment actions are taken. All planning must follow the mandatory directory structure exactly. Use `/deployments-implement` for actual deployment execution after planning is complete and approved.
