## 7. Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 7.1 Missing Files (CRITICAL)

1. **`fastapi-code-refactor-prompt.yaml`** - Must be created
   - Referenced by fastapi-code-refactor.md
   - Blocks command execution

### 7.2 Incorrect References (HIGH)

1. **python-code-refactor.md** references wrong YAML filename
