# Claude Code Slash Commands

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

This directory contains slash commands for Claude Code that can be invoked to execute structured development workflows. These commands follow the patterns described in the Claude Code advanced techniques documentation.

## Usage

Commands can be invoked in Claude Code by typing `/` followed by the command name. Commands support arguments using `$argument` or numbered placeholders like `$1`, `$2`, etc.

### Basic Usage

```
/enforce "implement user authentication"
/epct "shopping cart feature"
/debug "null pointer exception in checkout flow"
```

### Multi-Argument Usage

```
/component React UserProfile "user data display and editing"
/api POST /api/users "user registration"
```

## Creating Custom Commands

To create a new slash command:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category directory
2. Use `$argument` for single parameter commands
3. Use `$1`, `$2`, `$3` for multi-parameter commands
4. Include clear sections for different phases/aspects
5. Add quality checklists and requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Commands**: Choose the most specific command for your task
2. **Provide Clear Arguments**: Be descriptive in your arguments
3. **Chain Commands**: Use multiple commands for complex workflows
4. **Follow Protocols**: Commands enforce best practices - follow them
5. **Review Output**: Always review generated code before committing

## Integration with VS Code Toolkit

These commands are designed to work with the VS Code Toolkit deployment system. When deployed to a repository:

1. Commands are available in the project's Claude Code context
2. They follow project-specific conventions from CLAUDE.md
3. They integrate with configured MCP servers
4. They respect project-specific linting and testing requirements

## Troubleshooting

If a command doesn't work as expected:

1. Check the command syntax and arguments
2. Ensure you're in the correct directory
3. Verify CLAUDE.md is properly configured
4. Check for any error messages in the output
5. Try running with more specific arguments
