you task is to assist with updating the claude code cli commands in the ./.claude/commands/ dir ... specifically the .claude\commands\deployments\ dir.... these were copied from the
    .claude\commands\code\ dir... you are to now further refine these commands to insturct claude code cli how to design and code/write the "deployments" patterns for the target repo based on
    per the industry and public best practices... you will include the best practice sofware archtiecture and design principles, design patterns, cicd pipelines for deploying the target repo as a
  univerally k8s microservices pods, apps, services, components, storage, networking, security, monitoring etc. app pods and app containers must be aways be deployed in the exact same architecture
  patterns as defined by the repo for all environemnts (dev, staging, test, prod etc.) and must be universally deployable to local k8 single host instances, k8s clusters, aws, azure, gcp etc.  ....
  you must use your sub agents and all your mcp tools available to complete this task... you must also define a mandatory dir and file structure as part of the commands/instructions that MUST BE
  STRICTLY ADHERED TO... AND MANDATE KISS PRINCIPLES when creating the deployment manifests, configs etc.




  agreed,  1. Broken Command References (HIGH SEVERITY)
      - 3 non-existent commands referenced: /fastapi-code-refactor, /fastapi-router-implement, /fastapi-service-implement - CREATE THE COMMANDS AND MCP YAML PROMPTS
      - Breaks workflow continuity
    2. Unrealistic Deliverable Specifications (HIGH SEVERITY)
      - 10 Jupyter notebooks per command (60 total)
      - Should be reduced to 2-3 per command - AGREED. the documentation commands MUST PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION.. THE CODING COMMANDS ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CREATING DOCUMENTAION... AKA... ANY COMMANDS THAT
  ARE DOING SOMETHING MUST NOT CREATE DOCUMENTATION... EXCEPT FOR ANALYSIS 3. Create workflow diagram showing actual command relationships - AGRRED 2. Add navigation structure between commands -
  AGREED ... NO UPDATE AND ADD AS INSTRUCTED .... USE YOUR SUB AGENTS AND MCP TOOLS, ENSURE THAT ALL DETAILS ARE AS PER THE LATEST BEST PRACTICES AND VERSIONS OF PACKAGES/APPS/N=BINS ETC...


 ADD/UPDATE:
- missing or Broken Command References
- non-existent commands referenced

Jupyter notebooks per command:
- Should be reduced to 2-3 per command 
- the documentation commands MUST PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION.. 
- THE CODING COMMANDS ARE FORBIDDEN FROM CREATING DOCUMENTAION... AKA... ANY COMMANDS THAT ARE DOING SOMETHING MUST NOT CREATE DOCUMENTATION... 
- EXCEPT FOR ANALYSIS where reports / information is required to take action

Create workflow diagram showing actual command relationships
Add navigation structure between commands, and recommended next commands with parameeters for the user to apply and execute next


Missing YAML Files - All commands reference non-existent YAML prompt
Outdated Next.js Patterns - Uses deprecated Pages Router instead of current App Router (Next.js 15+)
USE CURRENT VERSION PATTERNS AND TECHNOLOGIES

- Simplify security examples (helmet.js configurations are overly complex)
- Add Node.js 21.x LTS features
- Modernize framework-specific guidance

USE CURRENT VERSION PATTERNS AND TECHNOLOGIES


REMOVE NEXTJS, VITE, FRONT END CONTENT... THEY WILL HAVE SPECIFIC COMMANDS FOR FRONTEND CODING ETC.

you must always use your sub-agents, mcp tools context7, grep, fetch, web search, to get the lastest information and documentation / best practices


now review the docuemntation content and all files that were just created... use your mcp tools and sub agents
focus on any gaps, best practices, missing files, content etc. that do not allign with the previous instructions and requirements



design principles, patterns, best practices for n8n AND designing agentic workflows AND business process automation... as part of this standard SLDC, software and automation best practies, design principles, SOLID, DRY and KISS principles must be enforced.... also priorities modular workflows design pattens, which are reusable and / or cloneable etc. plus the use of modular sub-workflows as part of the workflow  designs ... use your sub-agents and mcp tools to perform this instruciton and tasks


perform extensive research by using your sub-agents and mcp tools context7 and grep... plug websearch / fetch to create n8n commands and mcp prompts for the /.claude/commands/n8n dir.... there are existing prompts which shouble used as base prompt structures.
There is also a core prompt that defines the start to insructions for the llms and claude code ai to interact with the offical n8n mcp server. 

the first n8n workflow prompts/commands/instructions focused on n8n workflow design patterns and best practices.

the second n8n workflow prompts/commands/instructions focused on n8n workflow planning.

the next claude code cli command and mcp prompt yaml must focus on the outcome of the planning instructions and n8n workflow implementation, using the outcomes and artifacts from the n8n workflow design & n8n workflow planning prompts/commands/instructions.

you must create the claude code cli command and associated mcp prompt yaml which focuses on n8n workflow implement.

you must use the additional sources of information must come from n8n documentation and public resources on the internet.

this command and mcp prompt that you are creating will then inform the "test instuction... which will inturn inform the "validate" instuctions.... 

this suite of n8n prompts/commands/instructions are modelled on standard SLDC, software and automation best practies, design principles, SOLID, DRY and KISS principles must be enforced.... 
You must also priorities modular workflows design pattens, which are reusable and / or cloneable etc. plus the use of modular sub-workflows as part of the workflow  designs ... 

use your sub-agents and mcp tools to perform this instructions and tasks




  The user is asking me to create MCP prompts for n8n workflow design patterns and best practices. Let me break down what they're asking for:

  1. Use MCP tools (context7, grep) and other agents to research extensively
  2. Create n8n commands and MCP prompts for the /.claude/commands/n8n directory
  3. Focus on n8n workflow design patterns and best practices
  4. Source information from n8n documentation and public resources
  5. Include design principles, patterns, best practices for n8n
  6. Focus on agentic workflows and business process automation
  7. Follow SDLC, software automation best practices, SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
  8. Prioritize modular workflow design patterns that are reusable/cloneable
  9. Use modular sub-workflows as part of designs
