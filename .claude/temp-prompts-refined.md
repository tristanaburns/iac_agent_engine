### Ingress Configuration Patterns:

#### Standard Frontend Service Routing:
```yaml
# Example ingress configuration for multiple frontend services
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: frontend-services-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - your-domain.com
    secretName: frontend-tls-secret
  rules:
  - host: your-domain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 8080
      - path: /web
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web-frontend
            port:
              number: 3000
      - path: /admin
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: admin-dashboard
            port:
              number: 4000
```
