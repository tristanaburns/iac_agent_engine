    "## Why Hooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Space\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code, several challenges emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Quality Drift**: AI-generated code may not always follow project conventions\n",
    "2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Different sessions may produce differently formatted code\n",
    "3. **Platform Compatibility**: Unicode characters that work on Unix may fail on Windows\n",
    "4. **Manual Overhead**: Developers must manually run quality tools after each change\n",
    "5. **Lost Context**: Quality issues discovered later lack the context of why changes were made\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hook Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooks provide automated intervention points in the Claude Code workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "    A[User Request] --> B[Claude Processing]\n",
    "    B --> C[Response Generation]\n",
    "    C --> D{Hook Trigger}\n",
    "    D --> E[Automated Quality Control]\n",
    "    E --> F[User Sees Result]\n",

    "    style E fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By intercepting at key points, hooks ensure quality standards are maintained automatically without requiring user intervention."

    "## Architectural Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 1: Non-Intrusive Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "The hooks system operates transparently:\n",
    "- Runs in background after Claude responses\n",
    "- Doesn't block user interaction\n",
    "- Provides feedback only when issues are found\n",
    "- Maintains audit trail without cluttering output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 2: Fail-Safe Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Every automated action has a safety mechanism:\n",
    "- **Git Protection**: Create backup commits before changes\n",
    "- **Compilation Checking**: Verify code still works after fixes\n",
    "- **Automatic Rollback**: Revert if automation breaks code\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue working even if hooks fail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 3: Progressive Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "The system layers increasingly sophisticated checks:\n",
    "1. **Basic**: Format checking (non-destructive)\n",
    "2. **Intermediate**: Auto-formatting (safe transformations)\n",
    "3. **Advanced**: Refactoring (with compilation verification)\n",
    "4. **Expert**: Security and performance optimization"

    "The hooks system integrates with standard Python tooling rather than replacing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Existing Tools:\n",
    "1. **Industry Standards**: Black, isort, ruff are widely adopted\n",
    "2. **Configuration Reuse**: Respect existing pyproject.toml settings\n",
    "3. **Team Familiarity**: Developers know these tools\n",
    "4. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Works with IDEs and CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Not Custom Tools:\n",
    "1. **Maintenance Burden**: Custom tools require ongoing support\n",
    "2. **Trust Issues**: Developers trust established tools\n",
    "3. **Feature Completeness**: Existing tools are battle-tested\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Extensive resources already available"

    "## Summary: The Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "The Claude Code hooks system embodies several key philosophical principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invisible Excellence**: Quality should be automatic and transparent\n",
    "2. **Safe Automation**: Never break working code through automation\n",
    "3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Layer sophistication based on need\n",
    "4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fail safely without disrupting work\n",
    "5. **Standards Compliance**: Respect existing tools and conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety over Speed**: Better to be slow than break code\n",
    "- **Transparency over Magic**: Users should understand what happens\n",
    "- **Integration over Replacement**: Work with existing ecosystems\n",
    "- **Prevention over Correction**: Catch issues early\n",
    "- **Context over Rules**: Adapt to project needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ultimate Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The hooks system aims to make quality automatic, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving while the system handles routine quality maintenance. It's not about enforcing rigid rules, but about maintaining consistency and preventing common issues that waste developer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these principles, developers can better utilize the system, extend it appropriately, and trust its automated decisions."
